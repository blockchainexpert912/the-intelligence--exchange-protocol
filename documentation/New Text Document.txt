Thanks for your payment. I got 1k from your coinbase account.

1. Considering Coinbase issues, if weekly payments are difficult, how about making payments once every two weeks?
2. Except for this week, the phase 2 development took 4 weeks and it was successfully completed. So, if possible, I would appreciate it if you could finish the payment for the phase 2.

Payment for Phase 2 Development :
Contracted payout: $8000 (= 4 * 2000)
Amount paid: $4200 (= $3200 + $1000)
Remainder amount: $3800 (= $2200 + $400 * 4)
correct?

Note: Made payment status table for you to make it easy to manage payment.

3. Unlike the phase 1 and phase 2 of development, in the phase 3 of development, most smart contracts and backend APIs have a close relationship.
Therefore, I propose that we set the scope of Phase 3 development to all features except the Dutch Auction Marketplace, which will be completed by July 15.
I have discussed this with Isom, and he has agreed. Do you agree?

While discussing phase 3 development, I had already discussed it with Isom, and he agreed.
Agree?

4. If possible, we would appreciate it if you would change from split weekly payment ($1600 + $400) to single weekly payment ($2000) from the phase 3.
Is it possible?

5. Additional questions raised in phase 3 development:
a. When investors buy/sell on the marketplace with their Investor Model NFTs, we plan to provide an automatic royalty rewards withdrawal function to the owner.
Agree?
b. Creator NFTs owned by data scientists are not transferable to other owners (suggested by Isom).
Agree?
c. Subscription Logic
- Business first deposits INTELL or USDT to subscribe to the required model.
- Business subscribes to the desired model.
- Subscription cycle is monthly. (e.g. 10000$/mo)
- He deposited 55000$ and started the subscription. He unsubscribed after 100 days (3 months and 10 days). In this case, the amount paid is 40000$ and the remaining balance is 15000$.
correct?
- Also, he deposited 55000$ and started the subscription. After 150 days (5 months) it is automatically unsubscribed by TIEX Finance Contract and Subscription Contract and the remaining balance is 5000$. correct?

6. "Perhaps this year to be listed on unit swap"  you emailed to me before.

May I know what your INTELL token Presale plan is? I have good experience in listing Tokens on Uniswap. The motto of my token presale is to build a very secure market with no dump and bump. In particular, according to the roadmap in your whitepaper, your project can be very active from at least 6 months later, unlike other projects, and I think it is very important to keep the token price safe without any dump or pump until then. Also, I think you need to pay attention to the INTELL market architecture so that real profits can be provided to all initial presale investors.


Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Dmitry
